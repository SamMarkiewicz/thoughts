It was not the first attempt I had since the last three years, but this time, I tried to convince myself that I had to make it and, for once, succeed.
I don&rsquo;t think that the main reason was because running is a sport I like. I mean, who <em>really</em> like running ?
No, I really think that there was a bigger reason, mainly correlated with major and minor switches in my own life.</p>

<p>I started to run seriously for the first time during my months of break in Australia.
The conditions were perfect, both in terms of weather (of course), but also in terms of state-of-mind.
I really think that if you want to start running, you have to make it easy.
Running is not something sweet. It&rsquo;s not like swimming. It&rsquo;s an experience between you and yourself.</p>

<p>An experience that implicates mind loneliness, and physical pain (at least, during the first sessions), so, you&rsquo;d better have to begin in the best situatioon or context possible.
That said, this is just my own opinion, and some of you will surely start in an other context, but, to me, it helped me a lot to start on that kind of basis.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that the very first sessions were pathetic, but in a sense, they were.
Discovering that you&rsquo;re only able to run for 12 straight minute is always a shock. Really.
It reminds me two thing : my age (not so old, yes, but not a teenager anymore), and the great lack of exercise and healthness in my life during the last 5 years.
Working in any job including to sit down for 8 hours a day is definitely not a good thing for your health. Some studies have said that at some point it was almost harmful as smoking.  In a way, I guess that it&rsquo;s not wrong.</p>

<p>With exception of my lungs and heart, that were obviously in retirement since a long time now, I also discovered that my legs were just a part of my body that were not in good shape too.
Sitting down for hours, taking your car to go from one point to another (even if it&rsquo;s for a short distance) can have disastrous effect on those largeley underrated parts of your body&hellip;
And so, my first running sessions were painful&hellip;
BUT, in the same time, I also had a feeling of accomplishment that I had never felt in a long time.
Because all that pain brings you more rewards that you think, both physically and mentally.</p>

<p>Because you can see your progression, little by little, run after run. You run longer, the pain diminishes, and moreover you can find at some point, a kind of inner peace.</p>

<p>Slowly, running became a routine, and a thing that is now intricated with my everyday life.
A kind of philosophy. A way of life.
That&rsquo;s the main reason of why I want to share this with you.
I know that there are a lot of people out there that tried to start running, and many of them who, like me, stopped after two or three sessions.
I hope that I&rsquo;ll give them a bit of motivation, or some tips.</p>

<p>Running 5k is not impossible. It&rsquo;s just the beginning.</p>
